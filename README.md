Introduction to CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style HTML documents. It enhances the look and feel of web pages by controlling layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements.

Key Features: Separation of content (HTML) and design (CSS). Reusability across multiple HTML pages. Responsive design capabilities with media queries. 2. CSS Basics A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block:

css Copy code selector { property: value; } Example:

css Copy code p { color: blue; font-size: 16px; } Types of CSS: Inline CSS: Applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute. Internal CSS: Defined within the <style> tag in the <head> section. External CSS: Linked through the <link> tag. 3. CSS Selectors Selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling.

Common Selectors: Universal Selector (*): Targets all elements. Element Selector (p): Targets all <p> elements. Class Selector (.classname): Targets elements with the specified class. ID Selector (#idname): Targets the element with the specified ID. Example:

css Copy code

{ margin: 0; padding: 0;
} 4. Box Model The box model determines the space taken by an element on a webpage. It consists of:

Content: The actual content (text or images). Padding: Space between content and border. Border: A line surrounding the padding. Margin: Space outside the border. Example:

css Copy code div { margin: 20px; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid black; } 5. CSS Layouts The Display Property is crucial for determining element layouts:

block: Takes up the full width of its container. inline: Takes only the necessary width. inline-block: Behaves like inline but allows width/height. flex: For flexible layouts. grid: For grid-based layouts. 6. CSS Positioning CSS positioning allows elements to be placed in specific locations.

Position Types: static: Default, follows normal flow. relative: Positioned relative to its normal position. absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. fixed: Stays in place when scrolling. sticky: Toggles between relative and fixed. Example:

css Copy code .fixed-header { position: fixed; top: 0; width: 100%; } 7. Flexbox Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, offering easy alignment of elements.

Key Properties: display: flex; justify-content: Align items horizontally. align-items: Align items vertically. flex-direction: Defines layout direction (row, column). Example:

css Copy code .container { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; } 8. Grid Layout CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system.

Key Properties: display: grid; grid-template-columns: Defines the number of columns. grid-template-rows: Defines the number of rows. grid-gap: Adds spacing between grid items. Example:

css Copy code .grid-container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); grid-gap: 10px; } 9. CSS3 Features CSS3 brings advanced styling capabilities like gradients, animations, and more.

Key Features: Rounded Corners: border-radius. Box Shadows: box-shadow. Gradients: linear-gradient and radial-gradient. Transforms: rotate(), scale(), translate(). Transitions: Smooth animations between styles. Example:

css Copy code .box { border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); transition: all 0.3s ease; } 10. Animations and Transitions CSS3 enables dynamic effects through animations and transitions.

Transitions: Used to animate changes smoothly.

Example:

css Copy code button { transition: background-color 0.5s ease; } button:hover { background-color: green; } Animations: Keyframes allow complex animations.

Example:

css Copy code @keyframes slideIn { from { transform: translateX(-100%); } to { transform: translateX(0); } }

.animated-box { animation: slideIn 1s ease-in-out; } 11. Media Queries Media queries adjust styles based on device characteristics (e.g., screen width), enabling responsive designs.

Example:

css Copy code @media (max-width: 768px) { .container { flex-direction: column; } } 12. Responsive Web Design Responsive web design ensures that websites are usable on all devices.

Techniques: Fluid Grids: Use percentages instead of fixed widths. Flexible Images: Use CSS to resize images. Media Queries: Adjust layouts based on screen size. 13. CSS Best Practices Keep It Simple: Write concise and maintainable code. Use Class and ID Selectors: For flexibility. Modular CSS: Break down styles into reusable parts. Minify CSS: Compress for better performance. Use Preprocessors: Tools like SASS or LESS speed up development. 14. CSS Interview Questions and Answers

What is the CSS Box Model?
The box model defines how an element is structured (content, padding, border, margin).

Explain the difference between relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning.
relative: Positioned relative to its normal position. absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest ancestor. fixed: Fixed in the viewport. sticky: Switches between relative and fixed based on scroll. 3. What is the difference between inline and block elements? inline: Takes as much space as needed, no new line. block: Takes full width, always starts on a new line. 4. How do Flexbox and Grid differ? Flexbox: One-dimensional (either rows or columns). Grid: Two-dimensional (rows and columns). 5. What are pseudo-classes in CSS? Pseudo-classes define special states of elements (e.g., :hover for mouse hover).

What are CSS transitions and animations?
Transitions: Smooth changes from one style to another. Animations: Keyframe-based, allowing complex animations.
